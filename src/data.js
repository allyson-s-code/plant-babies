You can train a hoya plant as a vine, or allow it to trail over the side of the container. Either way, expect the full length or height of the plant to be 2-4 feet. Hoyas thrive best when they get bright, non-direct sunlight. Hoyas should be watered weekly, and left to let dry completely between waterings.",

Plants that are kept too cool or too dry are likely to lose their leaves or suffer from fungal infections that can cause the plant to die from root rot or collapse. Likewise, plants that are exposed to too much sun can become washed out and develop brown blotches on their leaves. In the winter, when the plants go into dormancy (and sometimes die back completely), provide them with bright light to maintain growth.",

Avoid watering directly into the center of the plant, as this can encourage mold growth and rot in the dense nest. Aim water at the soil to avoid wetting the fern's fronds.",

The flattened leaves are stemmed segments that hang and drape from containers and hanging baskets. Flowers form at the ends of the stems—so the more stems your plant has, the more flowers it will have. Though it is a cactus, its tropical origins make this plant crave more water than most.

It’s important to note that purple shamrock plants actively grow and flower during the fall to spring and go dormant in the summer. This might not happen every year, especially for houseplants, but it’s a possibility that requires some different care. When they are dormant, the foliage will degrade. If you see this occur, reduce watering and stop feeding your plant. As soon as you see new foliage begin to grow, resume your plant’s normal care routine.",
